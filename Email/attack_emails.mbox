Would like any sort of business-related internship this summer.
I'm a freshman this year, so that's probably one of the bigger barriers.

Some specific specifications for internships would include startups.

Paid/unpaid are probably relative to where it's located. I'm okay with unpaid if it's in Michigan. I'm okay with going farther away if it's paid or if it's for a major company.

Thanks! Looking forward to trying out this service!

I am currently a senior attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; studying Statistics and African American Studies. I have dedicated myself and I have worked intensely to become a University of Michigan honor student and obtain a 3.334 grade point average. During my academic career at the University of Michigan, I have mastered both written and verbal communication skills as well as developed excellent prioritizing, time management, and social skills. I am very eager to work outside of my comfort zone and I have always had an extreme passion for not only Statistics and data analysis but for numbers and mathematics as a whole.  I am a former member of the MREACH program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business where I developed business project management skills; including developing a business plan, budgeting, and managing the day to day operations in a multi-task environment. I have enclosed my resume as a first step in exploring the possibilities of intern
 ing with your organization.

Furthermore, I enjoy people; work well with others, and I welcome the opportunity to participate in groups to help achieve a common goal. I have the ability to help your client continue to achieve and obtain upcoming goals while accomplishing future success.

I look forward to the opportunity of becoming acquainted with you.  Please feel free to contact me at the numbers on my resume. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hi there! My name's Kevin Lee. I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in Music. I consider myself a very creative individual, with lots of passion in the arts, and am enjoying ways to express this with Computer Science code. I hope to work in the field getting any experience I can, although am particularly interested in music-related and/or video-game design / programming. Thanks!

I am a junior studying Industrial and Operations Engineering who will be in senior standing after this semester (Fall 2014) is completed.  I am also working towards a "Program in Sustainable Engineering" which is essentially a concentration in sustainable engineering.  I am seeking internship opportunities in the areas of supply chain management, operational systems (logistics), manufacturing, and potentially consulting.  I would like to focus, or at least work with, the sustainability aspect within each individual realm, if possible.

I am a First Year Masters Student in Industrial and Operations Engineering. I am looking for a summer internship beginning May 2015. I would like to get connected to companies like Google, McKinsey & Company, Victoria's Secret, General Electric, Bloomberg L.P, Buzz Feed. These organizations have openings as analysts or supply chain interns which i believe is my field of interest. 

Prior to pursuing my Masters degree, I have 2 years of full time work experience in a world renowned Automobile major where i worked as an area manager in the customer service department. I had undertaken various projects which has helped the organization increase both its customer satisfaction index as well as increase profits by 30%.

I would like to use this as a platform by which i can connect with recruiters. The same would help me in acquiring an interview opportunity through which i can gain an summer internship with one of the reputed firms.

Regards,
Subramanaian Sharath

I am a current Freshman at the University of Michigan, and I aspire to be a psychiatrist studying mental disorders. I intend to complete an MD/PhD program so that I can be a physician scientist, because I love conducting research but do not want to lose the connection with the people I am trying to help. I am looking for a summer experience that will better equip me for these aspirations, so something in which I am conducting research through a psychiatric department and/or directly dealing with patients would be optimal.

As an Engineering student, I have always dreamed of using my Mechanical Engineering degree to help others. My dream job would be doing research and design for a prosthetics or robotics company. I would love to make connections to companies that do this sort of work, so that I can learn more about these types of opportunities. I would also like to be connected to other research and design companies, even those not directly in the robotics or prosthetics fields.

I would love to stay in Michigan, either near Grand Rapids or Ann Arbor, but I would be willing to travel.  I am currently a student in Materials Science Engineering and have an interest in prosthetics and biomedical devices. I would also love to work with or around animals if I cannot find anything related to prosthetics or biomedical devices. Basically I am looking for an internship for the summer that would have me doing a variety of tasks.

I'm from the Chicago area and would love a summer job or internship in the city. There are a number of museums and galleries that offer small internships, but even an art-based internship at a larger corporation would be incredible for connections. I'm also a chemistry major looking to work in the applied arts so even lab experience would be great.

I consistently strive to enhance my networking skills and have always been confident in my ability to communicate with others. I have proficient writing skills and am a detail-oriented perfectionist. Volunteerism has allowed me to gain insight into people and the different ways to assess and meet their wants and needs.

I desire to work in a science lab setting. As a pre-med sophomore, I find the function of the skin to be intriguing, and would love the opportunity to work in a dermatology lab at Michigan. Other lab assistant positions would be welcomed too. I am looking to get more experience in a lab setting to see if I would be interested in pursuing research a career. 
Thank you,

I am a MSE in Construction Engineering & Management student graduation december 2014. I am actively looking for a full time opportunity starting february in a construction firm as a project engineer. Being an internation student I have realized that it is very difficult to get into a company without the right connections due to sponsorship issues. Getting in direct contact with the right people at these firms increases your chances of convincing them to employ you for the right reasons.

I was the Video Editorial Intern for Birchbox in New York, New York during the summer of 2014; the internship allowed me to experience life in a corporate setting and work on video content for an online magazine. This coming summer I would like to gain more experience with the production side of the media industry, whether it be in news, scripted television, or film.

I am primarily interested in working at agencies, either advertising or PR. I would, however, also be interested in working in a start-up environment or with a publication (online or otherwise). Essentially, I am looking for any position that is writing heavy–communications, public relations, blogging, social media management, etc. I'd prefer to work in a larger city as well. I'd like connections to UM alumni who are well-established in this field and are currently working at companies that may be hiring someone with my skill set.

Recent U of M Bachelor of Arts Graduate in English, minoring in Italian. I've studied abroad multiple times and have thoroughly grown from it, including living in Italy for approximately a year (leading me to my minor in Italian), and a semester in Paris through a study abroad program with  U of M. Along with my passion for exploring new places, I also have a deep appreciation for reading and writing. I'm a social media enthusiast and enjoy blogging and keeping up with current events on a daily basis. Similarly I enjoy mostly anything involving entertainment, television, or the internet. Due to the fact that I now live in an extremely small town, my connections are limited, and I'm hoping that through UMich Jobs that I can find connections and resources to further my career prospects.  Thanks! -Brandon

Hello,
I am currently a freshman at the University of Michigan double majoring in Finance and Computer Science. Since my start at this university, I have discovered a wide variety of opportunities to get involved on campus, whether that be through Multidisciplinary Design Programs, or entrepreneurship clubs like Entrepreneurship and Venture Club, or even the Michigan Business Club. These organizations have allowed me to connect with others who are currently working in various industries, and have given me real-world experiences that I can apply towards my goal of working in finance.  My hope is simply to gain more knowledge and understanding of the financial world through summer internships in the future. 
Thanks,
Jay Parekh

Hello! I am a Junior at the UMich school of Industrial Operations Engineering, with a minor in the Program of the Environment. I am from the Bay Area in Northern California and have worked for two startups there the past two summers. Here I feel I learned more than I could after endless years at school through working with all parts of the team. One was Renovo Motors, a high-end electric car and the other has not been launched but is an app for helping people find local events. I have many interests, some more serious like sustainability, math and design; while others, maybe, less serious like my love for food, laughing, and bad puns.

Looking for an internship this upcoming summer in an engineering, business or quantitative field. I'm really looking to gain immediate working experience so I can pursue greater opportunities. Having some recruiter contact information or if I knew more employees from these tech companies such as Facebook or Google would be helpful in gaining more opportunities. I am just looking for an opportunity to prove myself and better my professional career. Location would not play a large role in an ideal job but one near Rochester Hills, MI or Ann Arbor would be suitable.

The Michigan network is extremely influential. Taking advantage of this powerful network, includes taking advantage of its large international scope. I would like to work in the Asian tech scene--but unfortunately do not have the connections to advise me on how to get there. Last summer, I worked at PayPal's Tel Aviv office. This experience taught me a great deal about the field of technology as well as the skills gained working for an multinational company. I hope to expand my work experience to different areas of the world. The internet and technology has a broad scope and audience. In order to fully understand the world we live in, and develop products for these stakeholders, we must travel to different parts of the world and experience fresh cultures. I don't only hope to contribute to this influential Michigan network, but I hope to shape it.

Hello,

 I would like to find internships in the following areas; advertising, digital marketing, social media, human resources, and personal relations.

I am an international student. The problem that I came across with when I was looking for internships is that most of the companies ask for work authorization in the US. However, as an international student, I need a written letter from the company, stating that they would like to hire me in order for me to get a CPT or an OPT.
Could you assist me in finding connections and opportunities that could possibly help me land an internship for the summer?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Regards,
Tilbe Cakar

Currently a student at the University of Michigan in my fourth year of undergraduate studies, I am studying Cell & Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering, while also working in the University's Department of Biomedical Engineering as a Research Assistant. Outside of the classroom, I served as an Engineering Intern at Terumo Cardiovascular Systems, a reputable medical device company with a focus on the support of cardiac and pulmonary care. I hope to one day work as a practicing physician or design medical devices using my engineering background. I am a determined, hard-working, focused individual who hopes to improve the medical and biotechnology fields through my work.

I would eventually like to pursue a master's degree or PhD in Child Psychology. Therefore, I am currently looking for research labs to work in as a research assistant. I am also interested in jobs that involve working directly with children.

Message:
As I've gone through my academic career as a Psychology major and a Community Action and Social Change minor, I have educated myself about both people on an individual basis as well as how the society around myself is structured. One particular area of this that interests me a lot is how social structures work unfairly against specific groups and identities of people. I'm hoping to go on to Graduate school and law school after I graduate in order to pursue an MSW and a JD through the joint degree program at The Michigan School of Social Work. I'm hoping to find an internship at a non-profit or some other area that effects real change within the community or society at large. If I could get some exposure to how law can interact with social change this would be an amazing opportunity to try my hand at change at trying to better the world around me!
